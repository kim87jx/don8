                    <h3> Our Conclusion:</h3>
                        <p class="lead">Through the competitor reviews, we’ve learned that many platforms that are for second hand consignment focus more on profit rather than promoting a sustainable lifestyle. The upcoming thrifting platforms are mostly catered to a younger audience and women, which is not easily inviting and inclusive for all. We also noticed that many of the local thrift shop websites are poorly developed and do not have an accessible format for finding donation information. We would like to focus on filling the gap between different generations to accommodate people of all ages, and cater towards people looking to donate and not sell their items.</p>

We decided on a minimalistic and clean design so we chose two fonts that were simple enough and easy for users to read which were Montserrat and Open sans.</p>

                         <h3>Images</h3>
                         <p class="lead"> Then, we collected images that we would need for the app such as photos of three different maps, one in color, light mode, and dark mode. </p>

                         <h3>Inspiration</h3>
                         <p class="lead"> To find some inspiration for the overall mood and design of our application, we found different sample designs for other apps that conveyed minimalistic and earth tone designs. Instead of sharp edges, we went for more rounded corners and soft shapes to add comfort and an organic feel to our app.</p>

        <p>Our application’s name is Don8. It allows users who donate second hand items to more easily find information and instructions on how the donation process functions at specific donation sites. You can see donation sites nearby, schedule a pickup, and promote and find yard sales. </p>

                        <h2>Low-Fidelity Feedback</h2>
                        <h3>Positive Feedback</h3>
                        <p class="lead">The positive feedback we received mostly consisted of users finding the majority of our prototype to be very simple and intuitive. It did not make users think super hard and they understood how to complete most tasks. One of our follow up questions after users tested our prototype was “When you see the opening page, what do you think the app is about?” Participants responded that they knew right away that it was some sort of donation app. Another question we asked was “how frequently do you believe you will use this app?” participants responded with a range from once a month to monthly. Users completed each of our tasks fairly quickly spending about 10-20 seconds on each task. Creating an account was the simplest task, and users had no problems completing this task.  However, there were some areas of feedback that we will need to take into account in order to improve our design.</p>

                        <h3>Feedback: What Needs Improvement</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Iconography:</strong> One user reported that the yard sale sign icon was not clear on the bottom navigation. They pointed to the icon and stated “I don’t know what that is.”</li>
                            <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Users struggled with where they are supposed to enter dates in the task of filtering. They also struggled with where to enter their address in the map task. </li>
                            <li><strong>Placement:</strong> Users were unable to see some of the icons and buttons on the top right corner. </li>
                            <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> On the pickup task, users were immediately prompted to allow or deny using their location, but there was no button to reach that point. One user said “is this where it starts?”</li>
                        </ol>

                            <h3>How We Will Improve Our Design</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Task/Flow 1</strong> - <u>Make an account/sign up:</u> We could add an autofill feature for returning users.</li>
                            <li><strong>Task/Flow 2</strong> - <u>Plan a drop off:</u> we should add drop off and pick up to the navigation. We could add a page with a drop down menu that has the option to drop off or pickup and then the user will be prompted to pick a date to complete that action. 
 </li>
                            <li><strong>Task/Flow 3 </strong> - <u>Filter search results:</u> We can add more options for filtering.</li>
                            <li><strong>Task/Flow 4</strong> - <u>Promote a yard sale:</u> We can move the plus icon lower so it is easier for users to see. </li>
                            <li><strong>Task/Flow 5</strong> - <u>Setting up notifications:</u> We can add a small icon on the listing of the stores for a “quick notification pop-up”</li>
                            <li><strong>Task/Flow 6</strong> - <u>Find a store nearby by entering your location:</u> Make it more clear where to type in an address and where to change from list view and map view. Also we could add different modes of transportation like walking. </li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2>High-Fidelity Prototype</h2>

   <p class="lead">After realizing the limitation of finding information on thrift stores' sites, we wanted to provide a better application that can help and encourage people to donate and do sustainable shopping. With that purpose, Don8 was created. Although our application design is not yet fully completed, we believe it would be helpful for users in their donating process. Overall, we have learned many aspects of designing an application. Besides how to use the assistant websites for the study such as Figma or Miro; team communication or usability testing. During the study, we had the opportunity to approach outside realistic experience by interviewing users, managers, and owners of local thrift stores. Because this was our first time, we had some difficulties in getting their interview acceptance. However, by going through this, now we have the experience so we can do better in the future. </p>
